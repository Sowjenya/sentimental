Answer: So far I attended IT Assessment problems in aptitude, reasoning, analytical and difficult level will be  moderate. But coming to this evaluation is too challenging for me as a fresher. I got so much knowledge through this evaluation -1. 

Below listed things are what I have learnt and how I come across and understanding, analysing , approaching from first question to last question :

part-A

I have learnt regular expressions in python with help of programming knowledge in data structures and oops concept method
Sentimental analysis is the first question which driven me into the sector data science which makes me interested and learnt natural language processing and python lib pandas , numpy

Ranking data-  Here I learnt visualisation, correlation using python library matplotlib and seaborn etc.

          Part -B
          
Grammatical corrector- I learnt different packages like language tool checker using python, transformers, hugging face , spelling checker etc and it took three days and I loved it.

2) Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

Answer:   The set of pairs (a,b) for all real  a ≥ b
